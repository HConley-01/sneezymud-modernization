In their never-ending quest to perfect their fighting abilities, a school of
warriors began focusing their training around the study of inflicting the most
devastating wounds possible in the fewest number of strikes.

These warriors refer to the concept as the "power move", and those trained in
it learn to use their weapons in brutal ways that catch opponents off-guard.

Their training results in a higher number of their basic attacks becoming
critical hits, which result in effects ranging from extra damage, to
dismemberment, to even instant death.

As the art focuses specifically on maximum damage per attack, these warriors
often achieve more damaging critical hits much sooner in a fight even when
compared to monks who learn the critical hitting ability. However, this focus
on power results in a less of an increase to their overall number of critical
hits.

Warriors who venture to learn the ways of the monk can receive the benefits
of both skills.
