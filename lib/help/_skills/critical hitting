Monks trained in the art of critical hitting become experts in the anatomy
of their opponents and learn to target vulnerable areas of the body with
pinpoint accuracy.

Because of this, their basic attacks are significantly more likely to turn
into critical hits, which result in effects ranging from extra damage, to
dismemberment, to even instant death.

Their training also allows them to bypass opponents' defenses more quickly,
resulting in more severe critical hit effects earlier in a fight.

Warriors who learn the Power Move ability gain similar expertise, but
where monks focus on volume of critical hits, warriors train to inflict
maximum severity.

Monks who also train as warriors are able to combine the skills and receive
the benefits of both.
